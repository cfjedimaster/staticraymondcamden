                <p>Ripple has been around for a while now, but only recently have I really noticed how freaking cool it is. I thought it might be helpful for my readers if I wrote up an introduction guide to Ripple and how you can more effectively use it. This will be a reflection of the issues and cool things I&rsquo;ve run into personally and as always, I&rsquo;d love to hear your opinions as well.</p>

<p>First and foremost, what in the heck is Ripple? Ripple is an open source project in incubation status at Apache (<a href="http://incubator.apache.org/projects/ripple.html">http://incubator.apache.org/projects/ripple.html</a>). Its aim is to allow your browser to emulate a mobile device. Currently it has support for both Blackberry WebWorks and PhoneGap. For this blog entry I&rsquo;ll just be focusing on PhoneGap.</p>

<p>It works via a Chrome extension, which means, obviously, it is Chrome only. You can get the plugin by either searching in Chrome&rsquo;s online store or by simply clicking <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geelfhphabnejjhdalkjhgipohgpdnoc">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once installed, your Chrome browser will get a new icon up by the URL:</p>

<p><img src="http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/ScreenClip170.png" /></p>

<p>The extension works with any HTTP-based URL, even your local server. You aren&rsquo;t required to upload your files to a public host. As a test, you can simply point to an HTML file on your local server and then click the Ripple icon.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/ScreenClip171.png" /></p>

<p>Click to enable Ripple and the page is reloaded with the Ripple emulator UI. Note - Ripple will (should) remember this setting. If you return to the page later it automatically loads Ripple. Just click the icon again to disable Ripple for that site. (Note - I&rsquo;m not 100% sure on how long this &lsquo;sticks&rsquo; - you may see something different.)</p>

<p><img src="http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/ScreenClip172.png" /></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a heck of a lot going on here. Each of the boxes surrounding your app allow for various configuration/testing options, but if you want to focus on just your app you can click the little arrows above the device simulator to hide them.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/ScreenClip173.png" /></p>

<p>You can selectively close them as well. (I.e., keep the right one open but close the left.)</p>

<p>For the most part the UI here should be self-explanatory. I&rsquo;ll go through it anyway  to provide some additional context.</p>

<h2>Devices</h2>

<p>The devices pod allows you to select from a pretty large set of options. What&rsquo;s cool is that this integrates fully with PhoneGap&rsquo;s <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_device_device.md.html#Device">Device API</a>. If you run the example code for the API and toggle between different devices, you see the right results in Ripple. Here are some examples.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/ScreenClip175.png" />
<p/></p>

<p><img src="http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/ScreenClip176.png" /></p>

<h2>Platforms</h2>

<p>To be honest, I never need to touch this. You can select PhoneGap 1.0.0 if you really want to, but honestly, I just leave it at the default. It always seems to default to PhoneGap 2.0.0 for me.</p>

<h2>Information</h2>

<p>Never use it. I suppose it is useful, but I&rsquo;d just click the header to minimize it.</p>

<h2>Accelerometer</h2>

<p>This allows you to test motion-enabled applications. You can either click on the little device and move your mouse or just click the Shake button. Everything described in the PhoneGap <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_accelerometer_accelerometer.md.html#Accelerometer">Accelerometer API</a> should work fine here. I <a href="http://www.raymondcamden.com/index.cfm/2013/1/15/PhoneGap-Sample--Shake-to-Roll">blogged</a> an example application of the accelerometer last month that made use of Ripple.</p>

<h2>Settings</h2>

<p>Again, should be obvious. Tooltips and Themes simply provide some UI options to Ripple itself. However, the <b>Cross Domain Proxy</b> is a very important one.</p>

<p>One of the issues you run into when using your desktop browser for mobile development is the inability of your Ajax code to make cross domain requests. This is a browser security issue and is pretty darn well out of your control. There are options though. In Chrome, you can start the browser with a flag to bypass that restriction. Another option is to just use JSON/P. Finally, if the remote service uses CORS, then you can just use the API without worry.</p>

<p>Ripple allows you to use remote APIs directly by simply using a proxy service. So when your code requests foo.com/fancy.api, Ripple intercepts this, makes a request for the data from its own server, and proxies the result back to you.</p>

<p>For the most part this just works, but I&rsquo;ve run into two situations now where it caused problems.</p>

<p>First - I did some testing a while ago against an API where everything worked fine in Chrome by itself (<b>when using the flag to allow cross domain calls</b>), but failed in Ripple. Why? I forgot that the API had employed remote IP rules. It worked fine from my IP, but not the remote IP. To fix that, I simply asked my friend to temporarily remove the IP rules.</p>

<p>Second - Ripple&rsquo;s proxy completely borked <a href="http://www.parse.com">Parse.com</a> calls. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure why, but it just did.</p>

<p>Luckily, there is an easy fix for that. Parse.com can work with CORS, and Ripple now lets you disable the proxy.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/ScreenClip177.png" /></p>

<p>I tested this a few minutes ago with a Parse.com demo and as soon as I disabled it, it worked fine in Ripple.</p>

<h2>Device &amp; Network Settings</h2>

<p>This allows you to set the connection type as well as simulate lag. Again, this is fully compliant with PhoneGap&rsquo;s <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_connection_connection.md.html#Connection">Connection API</a>. My latest article for the Adobe Developer Connection (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/phonegap/articles/using-parse-with-phonegap-part-2-the-phone-strikes-back.html">Using Parse.com with PhoneGap – Part 2: The phone strikes back</a>) discusses using the Connection API to enable/disable UI items based on network availability. It works great with Ripple.</p>

<h2>Geo Location</h2>

<p>You wouldn&rsquo;t normally need any help with Geolocation since it works just fine in Chrome, but Ripple lets you emulate different locations. This is <i>incredibly</i> helpful during testing.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/ScreenClip178.png" /></p>

<h2>Config</h2>

<p>If you are using config.xml files for your PhoneGap app, then Ripple will attempt to read and parse the XML file. Here is an example.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/screenshot61.png" /></p>

<h2>Events</h2>

<p>Finally, the Event section lets you simulate various events. This is not a complete list of events supported by the PhoneGap <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_events_events.md.html#Events">Events API</a>. As an example, the battery events are missing. But you could easily go into your console and trigger those events by hand if you need to.</p>

<h2>What Else?</h2>

<p>So to be honest, one of the reasons I avoided Ripple in the past is because I believed that&rsquo;s all Ripple supported. But that&rsquo;s not the case. For example, Ripple supports the PhoneGap <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_camera_camera.md.html#Camera">Camera API</a>. It works by simply asking you to upload a picture instead. Here is an example of what you would see if your app requests the device camera.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/ScreenClip179.png" /></p>

<p>Hitting Select File gives you a regular browser based file selector. Once you select a file, you even get a preview, much like a real device.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/ScreenClip180.png" /></p>

<p>Another feature that works is <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_notification_notification.md.html#Notification">notification</a> - partially. You can fire off a notification.alert but the title and button value attributes are not used. The callback worked, but fired immediately, not after I closed the alert. Vibration worked by simply shaking the simulator (which would be a pretty incredible vibration in real life I think).</p>

<p>Beep did not, but it brings up something cool. So what happens when you call an API not supported by Ripple?</p>

<p><img src="http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/ScreenClip181.png" /></p>

<p>As you can see, Ripple noticed the problem but provided you a quick way to handle it. You can type in a JSON result to &lsquo;fake&rsquo; the result you expected.</p>

<p>How about the <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_compass_compass.md.html#Compass">Compass API</a>? Yep, it works too. If you modify settings under Geo Location you will see them reflected in calls to the compass API. Again - I had just assumed that panel was for one feature. It never occurred to me that it would work with the compass.</p>

<p>How about the <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_contacts_contacts.md.html#Contacts">Contact API</a>? Create works just fine, although it isn&rsquo;t obviously storing a new contact on your desktop. Search fails, but again, Ripple handles it nicely, letting you paste in a JSON response.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/ScreenClip182.png" /></p>

<p>How about the <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_file_file.md.html#File">File API</a>? This is one I haven&rsquo;t played with yet. Chrome supports the File System API, so some parts should &ldquo;just work&rdquo;, but I&rsquo;d be surprised if the File Transfer portion works at all. (Then again, every time I think Ripple can&rsquo;t do something it surprises me.)</p>

<p><a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_globalization_globalization.md.html#Globalization">Globalization</a> does not seem to be supported at all currently. Ditto for <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_media_capture_capture.md.html#Capture">Capture</a> and <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_media_media.md.html#Media">Media</a>. I didn&rsquo;t even try <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_splashscreen_splashscreen.md.html#Splashscreen">Splashscreen</a> since it involves native settings as well.</p>

<p>Since the <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_inappbrowser_inappbrowser.md.html#InAppBrowser">InAppBrowser API</a> uses window.open, this will just plain work, but I&rsquo;d imagine the various events will not be supported.</p>

<p>And finally, <a href="http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/cordova_storage_storage.md.html#Storage">Storage</a> is just WebSQL so it will work fine in Chrome.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll wrap this up with one pretty crucial tip. When using Ripple, you <i>do</i> want to include a script tag that points to a copy of cordova.js. Unlike PhoneGap Build, this will be a <b>real</b> file on your file system. <b>It is crucial that you use the Android version, not iOS.</b> I lost time today trying to debug a very odd issue. My deviceready event was firing twice (and by the way, did I mention Ripple handles firing this for you automatically). The culprit turned out to be the iOS cordova.js file. Very odd, but luckily it was easy enough to get around.</p>

<p>As a last tip, you can find links to the source and support forums at <a href="http://ripple.tinyhippos.com/">http://ripple.tinyhippos.com/</a>.</p>
