      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following up on my previous non-tech/just for fun posts (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/12/23/books-i-read-in-2015&#34;&gt;Books I Read in 2015&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/12/22/my-year&#34;&gt;My Year&lt;/a&gt;), here is my favorite media of 2015. This was originally going to be my favorite music of the year, but I figured I&amp;rsquo;d expand it a bit to cover movies and video games too. This is obviously a very personal list, but hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll get some ideas about things to watch/play!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Favorite Music&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is in no particular order, but here are the tracks I listened to a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; this year. The first track, &amp;ldquo;Close Your Eyes&amp;rdquo;, is incredible. I first heard it on Sirius XMU and was just blown away. It sounds like a pop/rap/NIN mashup and is a great song to turn up real, real loud - just be sure the kids aren&amp;rsquo;t around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkGwI7nGehA&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of mashups, my favorite this year was a mix of NIN and Taylor Swift. The video is really well done too. Even better, my 5 year old just loves the hell out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DhvXST1Rc3g&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another surprise was the new Prodigy album - the first single was freaking awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/h1AaKBbNGkk&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More recently, this Grimes track has been on repeat for me as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tv9YoYCKNoE&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while not new, my favorite song from the past few years has been pretty consistent - &amp;ldquo;Wings&amp;rdquo; by HAERTS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yk52XHSpmF4&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Movies&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So yeah, the &lt;i&gt;big&lt;/i&gt; movie for me was - obviously - the Force Awakens. I &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/12/18/review-star-wars-the-force-awakens&#34;&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; it already. But what else impressed me this year? I thought both &amp;ldquo;Avengers 2&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Ant-Man&amp;rdquo; were great Marvel films. I liked how different they were. One was a huge scale/popcorn chomping film while the other was much smaller, personable, still with great action. And while I&amp;rsquo;m not specifically writing up a TV section, &amp;ldquo;Jessica Jones&amp;rdquo; was &lt;i&gt;damn&lt;/i&gt; good too. As an aside, Netflix is the best thing to happen to TV in a long time. From their own content to their documentary selection to even some of their &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; flicks, I feel like I could easily pay more for the service. Speaking of Marvel - don&amp;rsquo;t bother seeing the Fantastic Four film. It isn&amp;rsquo;t watchable even if you can see it for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Inside Out&amp;rdquo; was easily one of the best children&amp;rsquo;s movies I&amp;rsquo;ve seen since &amp;ldquo;Up&amp;rdquo;. I loved &amp;ldquo;The Martian&amp;rdquo; and will be reading the book next year. &amp;ldquo;The Visit&amp;rdquo; proved to me that M.Night &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; have a tiny bit of talent left (stress - &amp;ldquo;may&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was initially a bit disappointed by &amp;ldquo;Mad Max&amp;rdquo;, but after watching it a second time I appreciate it a bit more. I still feel like it was more a &amp;ldquo;Film set in the Mad Max universe&amp;rdquo; then a proper &amp;ldquo;Mad Max&amp;rdquo; film, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just being too picky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one film I&amp;rsquo;d like folks to consider, it is &amp;ldquo;Maggie&amp;rdquo;. This flew &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; under the radar - I don&amp;rsquo;t think I saw it advertised once - but it is an incredibly well done zombie film. Outside of &amp;ldquo;The Walking Dead&amp;rdquo;, I&amp;rsquo;m really tired of zombies, but this is the best zombie film I&amp;rsquo;ve seen since &amp;ldquo;28 Days Later.&amp;rdquo; I highly recommend seeing &amp;ldquo;Maggie&amp;rdquo; as soon as you can. I never thought I&amp;rsquo;d see a zombie film that was slow and thoughtful - but this movie really pulls if off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2xSzwS_wK-0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and as for stuff I&amp;rsquo;m embarrassed to admit - my guilty pleasure recently is &amp;ldquo;The Royals.&amp;rdquo; It is pure and utter trash, but fun to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1XvUYvdr3s&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For next year, keep an eye out for &amp;ldquo;Colony&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of alien invasion stories, especially ones that are far removed from &amp;ldquo;Independence Day&amp;rdquo;, and this one looks fascinating so far. You can watch the first episode online now if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to wait. Of course, like most sci-fi shows with a &amp;ldquo;mystery&amp;rdquo;, you have to assume it will probably get cancelled before they resolve anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oRLW-qQLMQs&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Video Games&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I just checked, and apparently, I only reviewed 2 video games this year - Battlefront and Destiny. I liked them both, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d consider them great. I&amp;rsquo;m spending a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of time during this Christmas break playing Fallout 4, and I like it a lot too, but again, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I&amp;rsquo;ll be thinking about it in a year&amp;rsquo;s time. As an example of what I mean - my eldest son recently borrowed my PS3 (the PS4 now rules my TV) so he could play &amp;ldquo;The Last of Us&amp;rdquo;, and I still tend to think of that game when I think about what makes a truly &amp;ldquo;great&amp;rdquo; video game. (And if folks are curious, my all time favorite game was &amp;ldquo;A Mind Forever Voyaging&amp;rdquo;.) I guess the best I can say is that I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying the three games I mentioned and I recommend them, but nothing has blown me away this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will add that both Sony and Microsoft have deals where if you pay for a yearly multiplayer subscription, you get free games every month. While the quality goes up and down, there have been some really great freebies. So even if you don&amp;rsquo;t play online a lot, you should definitely consider subscribing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Books I Read in 2015</title>
      <link>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/12/23/books-i-read-in-2015</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2015 15:16:33 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/12/23/books-i-read-in-2015</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yep, another lame, non-tech post. Sorry (not sorry). Today&amp;rsquo;s post is my list of books read in 2015. I record my books via &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goodreads.com&#34;&gt;Goodreads&lt;/a&gt; which has a set of widgets that - in theory - I could use - but every single one of them is broken. Oddly - dev tools didn&amp;rsquo;t reveal why they were so broken. So I decided to do something lame. I took their cool &amp;ldquo;year in review&amp;rdquo; blog post, snapped a picture of it with Firefox&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;screenshot&lt;/code&gt; command, and pasted it here. You won&amp;rsquo;t be able to click on any book and order them via Amazon, but I figure we&amp;rsquo;re all capable of searching, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m rather proud of the number of books I read - and even happier that there were so few stinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.raymondcamden.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/books.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;books&#34; width=&#34;654&#34; height=&#34;3638&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-full wp-image-7320&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Book Review: Ionic Cookbook</title>
      <link>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/12/02/book-review-ionic-cookbook</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2015 09:20:00 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/12/02/book-review-ionic-cookbook</guid>
      <description>&lt;iframe style=&#34;width:120px;height:240px;float:left;margin-right:10px&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ac&amp;ref=qf_sp_asin_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=raymondcamden-20&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=1785287974&amp;asins=1785287974&amp;linkId=P7BLQIK2B6F342SD&amp;show_border=true&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=false&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned now multiple times that I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of &amp;ldquo;cookbook&amp;rdquo; style technical books. After I&amp;rsquo;ve learned the basics of a language, I love to see real, if small, examples of applications built in a language so I can get a feel for what it&amp;rsquo;s like to actually develop with a particular platform. I was happy to get a review copy of what I believe is the first such book for the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ionicframework.com&#34;&gt;Ionic framework&lt;/a&gt;, Hoc Phan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Ionic Cookbook.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has over 250 pages of recipes covering a huge range of topics, demonstrating everything from different UI components of the Ionic framework to handling data storage for proper offline support. To be honest, much of what is covered in this book would be incredibly useful outside of Ionic as well. For example, the discussions on Firebase would be useful in a vanilla Cordova application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically a &amp;ldquo;cookbook&amp;rdquo; style book assumes you know the platform already, but this book spends time at the beginning introducing you to the basics of Ionic as well, so it would actually help someone who is new to Ionic as well. (Although I&amp;rsquo;d try to have some basic Cordova knowledge first.) At the end, Hoc even discusses how to publish your apps to the app stores, which is yet again a topic that will be useful to folks using Ionic or some other UI/UX platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While reading, I did find a few things I thought were done wrong, but honestly, those were more &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d do it this way&amp;rdquo; type things than real disagreements. Even better, I learned a few things as well. I definitely recommend picking it up!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finally! A good (darn good) Star Wars book</title>
      <link>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/09/20/finally-a-good-darn-good-star-wars-book</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 14:19:37 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/09/20/finally-a-good-darn-good-star-wars-book</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I make no secret of my Star Wars obsession - and yes - I&amp;rsquo;m counting the days till the next movie. (88 days if you&amp;rsquo;re curious.) As the new trilogy approaches, Disney is firing up the marketing machine quite heavily. I&amp;rsquo;m fine with that. Sure - some things are a bit silly. (Star Wars themed &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fangirlnation.com/2015/08/12/now-you-can-drink-star-wars-flavored-coffee-mate/&#34;&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; - um&amp;hellip; ok.) But there&amp;rsquo;s some pretty cool stuff too - including &lt;strong&gt;twenty&lt;/strong&gt; new Star Wars books. I&amp;rsquo;ve read three of these new books and while I wasn&amp;rsquo;t impressed with the first two, the last one I read was pretty freaking incredible. Here is a short review of the ones I&amp;rsquo;ve read so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style=&#34;width:120px;height:240px;float:left;margin-right:10px&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ac&amp;ref=qf_sp_asin_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=raymondcamden-20&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=055339147X&amp;asins=055339147X&amp;linkId=Q6EWVUH6DUSLPB4N&amp;show_border=true&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=false&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of the &amp;ldquo;Rebels&amp;rdquo; TV show, but this book was only so-so. I like seeing the early beginnings of the Rebellion, and the villain was pretty compelling, but overall though it just didn&amp;rsquo;t do much for me. It was an OK book but forgettable. This would be a good book to borrow from your local library but I&amp;rsquo;d probably skip picking it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear=&#34;left&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style=&#34;width:120px;height:240px;float:left;margin-right:10px&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ac&amp;ref=qf_sp_asin_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=raymondcamden-20&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=0345544854&amp;asins=0345544854&amp;linkId=GEDYY3X2OJL3CALG&amp;show_border=true&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=false&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt; So while &amp;ldquo;A New Dawn&amp;rdquo; was so-so and forgettable, this one was a book I wish I could forget. It has a great premise: Luke right after &amp;ldquo;A New Hope&amp;rdquo; - a hero - but still not a Jedi - is sent on a mission to extract a cryptographer working for the Empire. But then you end up with scenes where Luke uses the force to move noodles. Yes, seriously, noodles. I mean, I get that at this point he has the bare minimum of exposure to the Force but the &lt;i&gt;multiple&lt;/i&gt; (yes, multiple) scenes of him trying to move bits of food with the Force were painful to read. The ending was pretty bad too. About the only thing I really found interesting about this book was that after &amp;ldquo;A New Hope&amp;rdquo;, Luke was a Lieutenant. Yes, I found that interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br clear=&#34;left&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe style=&#34;width:120px;height:240px;float:left;margin-right:10px&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; src=&#34;//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;OneJS=1&amp;Operation=GetAdHtml&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;source=ac&amp;ref=qf_sp_asin_til&amp;ad_type=product_link&amp;tracking_id=raymondcamden-20&amp;marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&amp;placement=034551162X&amp;asins=034551162X&amp;linkId=LMTALH2NAVAZHZR3&amp;show_border=true&amp;link_opens_in_new_window=false&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt; And finally - a really, really good book in this new set. &amp;ldquo;Aftermath&amp;rdquo; takes place after the events of RotJ and we finally get a look at the universe leading up to the new movie. (To be clear, we had this years ago with the epic Thrawn series, but that&amp;rsquo;s the past. ;) As to be expected, blowing up the second Death Star and killing Palpatine didn&amp;rsquo;t just wipe out the rest of the Empire. In &amp;ldquo;Aftermath&amp;rdquo;, the Empire is hurt, hurt bad, but not destroyed. The New Republic (the formal government power headed by the Rebellion) is in the process of setting up and trying to bring the galaxy together in peace. Those details were fascinating but alone wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be enough to make a good book. Luckily, the book has some great characters. While older, familiar names are there, all of the main characters are new. (Ok, Wedge isn&amp;rsquo;t new, but he felt more like a side character than a main character.) Sinjir, a former Imperial loyalty officer, is easily one of my favorite characters in the Star Wars universe. Before I began this book I heard a lot of people complaining about this book. The writing style is unique - but frankly - didn&amp;rsquo;t bother me. (And by &amp;ldquo;unique&amp;rdquo; I mean a bit different, not crazy weird like &amp;ldquo;The Road&amp;rdquo; for example.) Also, apparently, some folks had a problem with the fact that a major character is gay, and apparently the female characters outnumber the male. Yeah, whatever. I mean, obviously the only reason to have a strong female character is to make some kind of liberal point, right? Ugh. I&amp;rsquo;m just glad I ignored the negative reviews and read it with an open mind because I thoroughly enjoyed the &lt;i&gt;hell&lt;/i&gt; out of this book and strongly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, while they aren&amp;rsquo;t books, I&amp;rsquo;m really enjoying all of the new Marvel comics right now - even the Lando one. If you read comics I&amp;rsquo;d definitely suggest picking them up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Review: Dave vs the Monsters</title>
      <link>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/07/12/review-dave-vs-the-monsters</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Jul 2015 11:58:58 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2015/07/12/review-dave-vs-the-monsters</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a fan of John Birmingham since I picked up the first book of his Axis in Time series. It felt like a more sci-fi infused Clancy series. The concept was pure geek day dream - send a fleet of modern day warships back in time and see how they impact history. But Birmingham did a great job of of showing the cultural impact of this transfer as well as the providing epic battle scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard of his new series, &amp;ldquo;Dave versus the Monsters&amp;rdquo; a few months ago, but had to wait until his novels became available in America. The premise is simple - an oil rig digging deeper than any before it opens a portal to another world. Take all the bad guys from a typical fantasy setting (orcs, demons, dragons, insect ninjas) and you&amp;rsquo;ve got the UnderRealms. (Yes, no space. My only complaint in the entire trilogy. It felt like the bad guys came from a Silicon Valley start up - which probably &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; how the world will end.) The denizens of this realm used to have contact with us and considered us nothing more than cattle. Obviously in the thousands of years since they last saw us we&amp;rsquo;ve changed a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the portal between our worlds opens up, we meet Dave, the main character of the series. As a hero he leaves a lot to be desired. In fact, he is a complete and utter ass. I&amp;rsquo;ve read through books before with a main character who is essentially an asshole, but I never found myself bothered by it in this series. As much of a disappointment this guy is, you can&amp;rsquo;t help but root for him as the story progresses. Early on, he does something that grants him - essentially - super powers - which helps him fight against the untold millions of creatures from the other world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one hand, you&amp;rsquo;ve got your basic geek fantasy - what happens when very strong fantasy creatures encounter a modern military force? You can probably guess. But things take a rather interesting turn after the first few massacres. The bad guys wise up and react in a way that I would never have guessed. I think any genre nerd could write a few cool battles between orcs and SEALs - but Birmingham takes this story in a much more intelligent direction that made the series very satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was truly surprising though was the humor, especially after the first book. I&amp;rsquo;ve read and enjoyed multiple books by Birmingham but I don&amp;rsquo;t think any of his previous books ever made me laugh at loud. There was one scene in the second book that I distinctly remember having a stupid big grin on my face as I read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I definitely recommend picking it up (and the Axis of Time series while you&amp;rsquo;re at it). Birmingham is also on Twitter (@JohnBirmingham) and one of those author&amp;rsquo;s who actually respond to questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/raymondcamden&#34;&gt;@raymondcamden&lt;/a&gt; the talons of the Lore Keepers kept missing the space bar. So they just typed it as one word&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; John Birmingham (@JohnBirmingham) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/JohnBirmingham/status/618863304849518593&#34;&gt;July 8, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>My 2014 Book List</title>

      <guid>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2014/12/27/my-2014-book-list</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Presented just for the heck of it, here is the list of books I finished in 2014. Like last year, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit disappointed, but considering I &lt;i&gt;doubled&lt;/i&gt; the amount of kids in my house, I think I have a valid excuse. My favorite of the year? Probably &amp;ldquo;Spin.&amp;rdquo; But I enjoyed the hell out of the Merchant Princes series. (My favorite genre is alt-history and I &lt;i&gt;especially&lt;/i&gt; enjoy alt-history books that mix in our world as well.) My least favorite was &amp;ldquo;The Uncertain Places.&amp;rdquo; I nearly gave up about halfway through.&lt;/p&gt;

        I&#39;d love to give this book a higher rating. It has a great premise, and cool moments, but so much of the book was mind numbingly boring I wanted to give up. It seemed like every other page was:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then Dan learned that his gate magic X&amp;hellip;

        I feel bad giving this one star as it wasn&#39;t a poorly written book, but I absolutely hated the main character so much I just despised the entire read. Sure, it was funny, but a funny story about an asshole is still a story about an assho...

        Exceptional! It just got better and better as it went on. Essentially one long &amp;amp;quot;heist&amp;amp;quot; novel set in a fantasy world. Definitely worth your time!

      <title>Early Access to My Next Book - Apache Cordova in Action</title>
      <link>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2014/11/25/Early-Access-to-My-Next-Book-Apache-Cordova-in-Action</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Nov 2014 08:11:00 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2014/11/25/Early-Access-to-My-Next-Book-Apache-Cordova-in-Action</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Hey - guess what? I&#39;m working on a book. This time the publisher is Manning, and one of the cool things they do is allow early access to a book. You basically pay for it while it is being developed and you can provide feedback to help improve the text. Obviously you get corrected/new chapters as they come out as well. If this is appealing to you, you can head over to the book page now.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://manning.com/camden/?a_aid=apachecordova&amp;a_bid=2a2a33f0&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/camden_cover150.jpg&#34; style=&#34;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://manning.com/camden/?a_aid=apachecordova&amp;a_bid=2a2a33f0&#34;&gt;&#34;Apache Cordova in Action&#34;&lt;/a&gt; will help readers learn how to use Apache Cordova. As you know, I&#39;m an avid user of Cordova and PhoneGap. Sometimes the documentation can be a bit difficult to grasp. I think the docs are good, but there are a lot of different things developers need to synthesize in order to really get it. This book - I hope - will help tremendously in that area.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Currently three chapters are available, and you can read the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.manning.com/camden/ApacheCordovainA_MEAP_CH01.pdf&#34;&gt;first chapter (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; for free. The fourth should be released very soon with other chapters coming every two weeks or so.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
For your perusal, here is the table of contents. This may change as the book is developed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Part 1: GETTING READY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
1 What is Cordova?&lt;br/&gt;
2 Installing Cordova and the Android SDK&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Part 2: CORE CONCEPTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
3 Creating Cordova Projects&lt;br/&gt;
4 Working with Cordova Plugins&lt;br/&gt;
5 Mobile Design and User Experience&lt;br/&gt;
6 Considerations when Building Mobile Apps&lt;br/&gt;
7 Creating Custom Plugins&lt;br/&gt;
8 Debugging Mobile Apps&lt;br/&gt;
9 Packaging Options&lt;br/&gt;
10 Using PhoneGap Build&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Part 3: WHAT&#39;S NEXT?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
11 Submitting to the App Stores&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Recommendation: The Merchant Princes series by Charles Stross</title>
      <link>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2014/02/23/Recommendation-The-Merchant-Princes-series-by-Charles-Stross</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2014 23:02:00 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2014/02/23/Recommendation-The-Merchant-Princes-series-by-Charles-Stross</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
Over the past month and a half I&#39;ve devoured the Merchant Princes series by Charles Stross. Originally released as 6 books, they are also available as 3 books (which is what the author originally wanted) and which I&#39;ve linked to below. I&#39;ve read Stross before and wasn&#39;t terribly happy, but I &lt;i&gt;devoured&lt;/i&gt; this series. On multiple occasions I had to force myself to slow down as I was so excited to see what happened next my eyes just kept racing ahead. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Broadly, the series is Sliders meets Game of Thrones meets Tom Clancy. The books revolved around a woman who discovers she is descended from royalty - but royalty in an alternate universe where history is somewhat different than our own. I&#39;m a sucker for Alt-History books in general, but this series brings in Alt-History with a dose of military/spy action and political/economic discussions too. I was worried the series would fall apart towards the end but it never let up. 
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My 2013 Reading List</title>

      <guid>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2013/12/30/My-2013-Reading-List</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
This is the year I finally stopped using Bagcheck, which is a good thing since it died earlier this year. I switched over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.goodreads.com&#34;&gt;Goodreads.com&lt;/a&gt;, which is OK, but frankly, I&#39;m not terribly interested in the social aspects of the site. I like tracking what I&#39;ve read and what I thought about what I read, but I don&#39;t necessarily care to track what others are reading. I &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; like getting recommendations, but my queue of books (thanks to folks who hit my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/o/registry/2TCL1D08EZEYE&#34;&gt;wishlist&lt;/a&gt;) has provided me with reading material over the past few years. Anyway, for folks who may be curious, here is my list from 2013. I&#39;ve got a few thoughts at the end.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Show static HTML/CSS as a placeholder in case js is not enabled - javascript include will override this if things work --&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  &amp;lt;style type=&amp;quot;text/css&amp;quot; media=&amp;quot;screen&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.gr_custom_container_1388416209 {
    /* customize your Goodreads widget container here&lt;em&gt;/
    border: 1px solid gray;
    border-radius:10px;
    padding: 10px 5px 10px 5px;
    background-color: #FFFFFF;
    color: #000000;
    width: 500px
  }
  .gr_custom_header_1388416209 {
    /&lt;/em&gt; customize your Goodreads header here&lt;em&gt;/
    border-bottom: 1px solid gray;
    width: 100%;
    margin-bottom: 5px;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 120%
  }
  .gr_custom_each_container_1388416209 {
    /&lt;/em&gt; customize each individual book container here &lt;em&gt;/
    width: 100%;
    clear: both;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
    overflow: auto;
    padding-bottom: 4px;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #aaa;
  }
  .gr_custom_book_container_1388416209 {
    /&lt;/em&gt; customize your book covers here &lt;em&gt;/
    overflow: hidden;
    height: 160px;
      float: left;
      margin-right: 4px;
      width: 98px;
  }
  .gr_custom_author_1388416209 {
    /&lt;/em&gt; customize your author names here &lt;em&gt;/
    font-size: 10px;
  }
  .gr_custom_tags_1388416209 {
    /&lt;/em&gt; customize your tags here &lt;em&gt;/
    font-size: 10px;
    color: gray;
  }
  .gr_custom_rating_1388416209 {
    /&lt;/em&gt; customize your rating stars here */
    float: right;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Overall, this was a year of disappointments. I had some bad luck this year in my choices. As an example, I almost never reread old books (again, I&#39;ve got too much new stuff to read!) but I made an exception for The Dungeon series. I had fond memories of it from when I was a teenager. It was ok for the first 5 books, but the last book was so horrible it made me want to throw the books away. I was also really disappointed by &#34;Scoundrels&#34;. It had everything going for it - a crime-centered Star Wars book - but failed to deliver. I guess it isn&#39;t fair to say it was a bad year, it just seems like I read more bad books this year then I have in the past.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
It wasn&#39;t all bad of course. Neil Gaiman&#39;s book was good - and I wasn&#39;t surprised at all by that - but I forget just how damn good he is. I was also &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; impressed with King&#39;s Wasteland book, &#34;The Wind Through the Keyhole.&#34; I loved the Wasteland series in general and was happy for the opportunity to return to that world. Overall the biggest surprise was &#34;It&#39;s Superman!&#34;, a novelization of the Superman story. This book had probably been on my shelf for over a year and I wished I had read it sooner. 
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>jQuery Mobile Web Development Essentials, Second Edition</title>
      <link>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2013/09/26/jQuery-Mobile-Web-Development-Essentials-Second-Edition</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 26 Sep 2013 11:09:00 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2013/09/26/jQuery-Mobile-Web-Development-Essentials-Second-Edition</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
I&#39;m very happy to announce that the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jquerymobile.com&#34;&gt;jQuery Mobile&lt;/a&gt; book that I wrote with &lt;a href=&#34;http://andymatthews.net/&#34;&gt;Andy Matthews&lt;/a&gt; has now been updated to the second edition. It covers jQuery Mobile 1.3.2 (we couldn&#39;t wait for 1.4 unfortunately) and includes new UI features like panels and responsive tables.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You can order the book from Packt right now here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.packtpub.com/jquery-mobile-web-development-essentials-2e/book&#34;&gt;Packt&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Another option is via the Amazon link below. I get a small kickback when you do and a kitten smiles. Amazon is showing the book as being unavailable till the end of October, but it really should just be a few more days.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I am proud of this book as I think it really helps explain jQuery Mobile in a simple, easy to approach manner. I hope you like it too.
&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My 2012 Book List</title>
      <link>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2012/12/31/My-2012-Book-List</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2012 12:12:00 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2012/12/31/My-2012-Book-List</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a list (via &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bagcheck.com&#34;&gt;Bagcheck&lt;/a&gt;) of the books I read in 2012. For the most part, it was a great year. I had two stinkers (in a row unfortunately), but in general, there were some damn good books here. Some high level comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&#34;11/22/63&#34; is easily the best time travel book I&#39;ve read. If someone asked for an example of the genre, this is what I&#39;d offer. It is light on the SciFi and heavy on the character drama, a bit unusual for King. (In comparison, &#34;Under the Dome&#34; was a good SciFi book with pretty shallow characters.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of King, his son, Joe Hill, is a damn good writer. I read two books by him this year and both were stellar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the stinkers, &#34;The Witch of Hebron&#34;, was truly disappointing. The second in the series, it has a very detailed, very realistic view of a post-economic crash America. That aspect is very well done. But for some reason the author felt the need to include a bit of magic and to me, it ruins it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking of apocalypse books, &#34;The Last Policeman&#34; was also a very well done book. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I loved the Star Trek trilogy I read. I haven&#39;t read a Star Trek book since I was in high school and I forgot how much I enjoy it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the high point of my year, the books I devoured, were the Kingkiller books by Patrick Rothfuss. &#34;The Name of the Wind&#34; and &#34;The Wise Man&#39;s Fear&#34; are easily two of the best fantasy novels I read in my life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Review: Railsea</title>
      <link>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2012/06/24/review-railsea</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 24 Jun 2012 11:06:00 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2012/06/24/review-railsea</guid>
      <description>&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?t=raymondcamden-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=0345524527&amp;nou=1&amp;ref=qf_sp_asin_til&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_top&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr&#34; style=&#34;width:120px;height:240px;float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px;&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever gotten me into a book discussion than you&amp;rsquo;ve most likely heard me praise China Miéville. In my mind, Miéville is the most fascinating author writing today. His works are difficult. Not in terms of language, although he does love to make up words quite a bit, but in terms of the worlds he creates. This is probably a poor analogy, but reading Miéville is painful in much the same way as a new exercise will hit muscles you don&amp;rsquo;t use often. His stories involve concepts that your brain simply wants to reject outright, and that&amp;rsquo;s what I love about him. To be clear, his books are &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; always great, and sometimes you can tell he is trying to be weird just for weird&amp;rsquo;s sake. But when it works - his writing is absolutely incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Railsea is loosely based on &lt;i&gt;Moby Dick&lt;/i&gt;, a book I&amp;rsquo;m embarrassed to say I haven&amp;rsquo;t read yet. The world of Railsea is one of large tracts of earth covered by a seemingly infinite collection of rails. Instead of oceans, there is simply the loose earth of Railsea and the harder earth of human civilization. The Railsea is a dangerous place. Large burrowing creatures live within the earth. I hate to make the comparison, but think Tremors. Walking across this earth is - essentially - a death sentence. People use the rails with trains of various sorts. Merchant trains, Navy trains, even pirate trains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main character, Sham, is on a &amp;ldquo;Moler&amp;rdquo; train - essentially this book&amp;rsquo;s version of a whaling ship. Instead of a whale, they hunt giant, and deadly, naked mole rats. The description of the hunts, life on the trains, and the world of Railsea in general is fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ending was a bit&amp;hellip; off. While the book was weird, the ending was a bit&amp;hellip; too weird. Miéville is not shy in hiding his political agenda, and I appreciate that, but the ending was a bit too blunt for my tastes. To be clear, it didn&amp;rsquo;t ruin the book for me at all. I still loved it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For folks curious - I&amp;rsquo;m now reading &lt;i&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/i&gt;. (50 or so pages in and it&amp;rsquo;s great!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sunday Review: Comics I Read</title>
      <link>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2012/05/27/sunday-review-comics-i-read</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 May 2012 11:05:00 +0600</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.raymondcamden.com/2012/05/27/sunday-review-comics-i-read</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a teenager, I was a regular, if somewhat casual comic reader. I picked up some X-Men, Spiderman, and, of course, Star Wars. However - I can still remember the day when I ran across this gem at my local store:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;http://www.comicvine.com/the-sandman-season-of-mists-chapter-6/37-34272/4207-34272-1-sandman-the/105-30794/&#39;&gt;&lt;img src=&#39;http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/sandman.jpg&#39;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had no idea comics could have such incredible artwork. Of course, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know what to expect when I actually &lt;i&gt;read&lt;/i&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read comics even more then, and throughout college, but afterwards, I slowly stopped picking them up. Once Sandman ended, I felt like there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much out there for me. (Obviously there was great stuff going on, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t know.) Plus, I got tired of the whole &amp;ldquo;trying to get the complete story&amp;rdquo; thing by buying what felt like 30 different X-Men titles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years back though I found myself drawn back. I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest and admit it was due to finding out you could download comics online. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know digital versions of comics existed, but it was enough to bring me back to my local comic store and start a monthly selection of comics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So - here is what I&amp;rsquo;m reading. They are in no particular order and are presented for you to comment, ridicule, and suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/GI_Joe_Cobra.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my first discoveries was the new line of GI Joe comics. These include: GI Joe, GI Joe: Cobra, and GI Joe: Snake Eyes. Each of these comics share the same world (there is also a GI Joe: Real American Hero) and a much grittier, realistic version of warfare. (If you have a somewhat loose version of realism.) You won&amp;rsquo;t see soldiers firing blue and red lasers. People, lots of people, actually die. The story is pretty damn incredible. In this version, Cobra was, until recently, an unknown entity. The story of how Cobra moves on to the world stage is pretty damn cool. I read GI Joe as a kid, and yeah, I still pick up the somewhat childish RAH one as well, but I definitely recommend this line. If you only select one though, get Cobra. As we know, the bad guys always have the best story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/PlanetOfTheApes.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forget the horrible remake. Heck, forget the really good recent movie. This comic is a fascinating look at the Planet of the Ape&amp;rsquo;s world and mythology. It has many threads tying it to the original movies but has a very unique take on the idea as a whole. Great artwork as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/fantasticfour601_cover.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just started reading Fantastic Four. I wanted to read one &amp;ldquo;mainstream&amp;rdquo; comic, and while I probably would have preferred an X-Men title or even Avengers, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d give FF a try. I never read them growing up, but something called me to it. I&amp;rsquo;m still not quite sure it&amp;rsquo;s worth the money, but any comic that features Galactus every now and then has to be good. The issue I read yesterday was pretty damn incredible, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to keep it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://www.raymondcamden.com/images/250px-Joehilllockekey.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I had to recommend only one comic it would be &amp;ldquo;Locke and Key&amp;rdquo; by Joe Hill (who is also a damn good prose author as well). A very dark fantasy/horror series, it just wrapped up its fifth set and is wrapping up with a final story line. (I know some folks don&amp;rsquo;t want to take a chance on a comic that never ends.) I&amp;rsquo;d also recommend &amp;ldquo;The Cape&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://rcm-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/cm?t=raymondcamden-20&amp;o=1&amp;p=8&amp;l=as1&amp;asins=1607064138&amp;nou=1&amp;ref=qf_sp_asin_til&amp;fc1=000000&amp;IS2=1&amp;lt1=_top&amp;m=amazon&amp;lc1=0000FF&amp;bc1=000000&amp;bg1=FFFFFF&amp;f=ifr&#34; style=&#34;width:120px;height:240px;float:left;margin-right:10px&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; marginwidth=&#34;0&#34; marginheight=&#34;0&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my final recommendation, try picking up &amp;ldquo;Sweets&amp;rdquo;. This book was written by a local creator, Kody Chamberlain. I&amp;rsquo;ve known Kody for some time now and his work is pretty damn stellar. I made him promise me to draw me into his next series in exchange for some software I wasn&amp;rsquo;t using anymore. All I hope is that I don&amp;rsquo;t end up as a murder victim.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I don&amp;rsquo;t think most folks care what I read in 2011, but I wanted to check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bagcheck.com&#34;&gt;Bagcheck.com&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; embed feature. Nothing to see here. Move along. (And of course, I&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much now guaranteed this post will get 20-30 comments&amp;hellip;)&lt;/p&gt;
